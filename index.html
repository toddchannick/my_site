      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I am a 27 year old aspiring software developer eager to explore the world of programming and the endless opportunities it has to offer.

        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          Born and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia, I have always had a strong connection with my city and value my tight-knit family and circle of friends. Over the course of my quarter-century on this earth, I have been on a never-ending quest for knowledge; a <span class="accent">life-long road trip</span>.  While my path has had its twists, turns, and detours, I am certain that each pit stop has taught me something about myself, and I don't regret taking time to enjoy the scenery. The dents, scratches, and setbacks have ultimately defined who and where I am today. I am grateful to live in an age where information is available at my fingertips and believe the internet is an invaluable tool. Being a self-educator, I don't know where I'd be without this ever-present wealth of knowledge.

      <h1>A Day in the Life</h1>
      <p>
        I have always embraced creativity, expressing it through <span class="accent">music</span>, <span class="accent">art</span>, even <span class="accent">science</span>. I have played guitar for 14 years and spend much of my free time designing digital art. I also enjoy the outdoors and exercise. While computers and technology are an integral part of my daily life, I highly value physical well-being. Bike rides, hiking, snowboarding, and weight-lifting are only a few of the ways I channel this passion. To me, a <span class="accent">healthy mind</span> and a <span class="accent">healthy body</span> go hand in hand.

      <h1>The Future is Bright</h1>
      <p>People too often separate their lives into work and leisure. I don't believe the two should be mutually exclusive. Following your passions and pursuing a career that is both fulfilling and enjoyable is the key to success and long-term happiness. My <span class="accent">dream job</span> is developing web or mobile applications that will have a noticeable impact on the user's life. In the age of technology, these powerful tools are beginning to define our culture and the way we live our lives. Physicians use apps like Epocrates to assist in diagnosis and treatment, and patient care has never been better. Online learning environments have become the universal norm in both high schools and universities, which has evolved education and student-teacher interaction. Music lovers will never be without their favorite songs with apps like Spotify and Pandora. From education to  wellness to enhancing creativity, the potential options are limitless...
